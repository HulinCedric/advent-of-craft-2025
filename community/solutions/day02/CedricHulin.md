## More feedback to share (optional)

- I loved the experience because: 
  - Kotlin is a very expressive language
  - I have setup the IDE and the project structure without too many pains
  - My IA mate helped me to tackle the problems in baby steps
- I found the exercise could be better if:
  - I had pair with a Kotlin mate to fill the gaps in my knowledge
  - I had not the feeling to be lost in the IDE, shortcuts, tests, etc
