## My Logs

### Day 1

- Stack(s) & exercise I touched: 
- Key reflection I picked:
	> What I reflected on today?
	> What I can do better.
- What this reminded me of (project, bug, design, team story): 

### Day 2

- I loved the experience because:
  - Kotlin is a very expressive language
  - I have setup the IDE and the project structure without too many pains
  - My IA mate helped me to tackle the problems in baby steps
- I found the exercise could be better if:
    - I had pair with a Kotlin mate to fill the gaps in my knowledge
    - I had not the feeling to be lost in the IDE, shortcuts, tests, etc
